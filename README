This is a small SQL-like compiler with a tokenizer, parser, AST, and interpreter.

It supports SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. The WHERE clause is recursive.

The makefile is used to compile and run this project. Use 'make' and then 'make run' to compile and run the project.

The database being used for the queries is stored in main.cpp on line 33.

When the program is run, it takes the query being input after a newline is sent. Here are some example queries to run:
    SELECT name, age
    FROM Customers
    WHERE age >= 21

    SELECT name, status
    FROM Customers
    WHERE status != "regular"

    SELECT name, status
    FROM Customers
    WHERE (age >= 21 AND active = true) OR status = "vip"
